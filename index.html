        <p>Hi! Welcome to my very first website. My name is Patricia Dalinis and I am a student at Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp. I am learning all about HTML, CSS, Java, Bootstrap, and various other tech-y sounding things. It's all very exciting.</p>
        <br>

        <p>When I'm not in class, I'm probably working. I'm a Contracting Officer for the U.S. General Services Administration. A.K.A. The Government's Landlord. While the work can be dry at times, it's nice to think that I'm helping other agencies be comfortable in their space, which helps them be productive civil servants.</p>
        <br>

        <p>Outside of work, I love to play video games, craft, watch horror movies, and play with SFX make up. I would love to work at a haunted house one Halloween season. I live in Chicago with my boyfriend, Andrew, and our two cats, Freddie and Gilly. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
